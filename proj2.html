	<h3>ABOUT</h3>
	<center><h4><p>"Privacy watch" is an installation that explores the relationship that we have with surveillance, whether it is unwillingly or we choose to ignore. The installation includes two projections; one projection inside of the bathroom stall and one outside of the stall, projected onto a large outer wall. The stall projection would be live surveillance of those who enter the stall, where audience members can see themselves being recorded inone of the most private and intimate places -- an example of how invasive surveillance can be. The outside projection displays surveillance captured from multiple locations in San Jose. "</p></h4></center>
