	<h3>ABOUT</h3>
	<center><h4><p>In this project, I utilized photoshop premiere to edit video and audio. The video's concept is experimental and the meaning of the video is up for interpretations. In this project, I tried to create a sense of ambiguity and discomfort by using very intimate shots and unusual scenes. The video depicts three (female) humans dressed as animals who take part in creating the gift of life. </p></h4></center>
